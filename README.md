# Measuring ocular media spectral transmittance using Purkinje Images

## Dependendence of measured ocular media density and light source spectral power distribution (SPD)

Quick'n'dirty approximation of the error in spectral ocular media density estimation using Purkinje images as a function of the (virtual) `age` (as specified by the [van de Kraats and van Norren 2007](https://doi.org/10.1364/JOSAA.24.001842) ocular media model, see [lensMediaWrapper.m](https://github.com/petteriTeikari/spectralLensDensity_purkinjeImages/blob/master/lensMediaWrapper.m) and [lensModel_vanDeKraats2007.m](https://github.com/petteriTeikari/spectralLensDensity_purkinjeImages/blob/master/lensModel_vanDeKraats2007.m) for code), half-bandwidth (`hbw`) and peak wavelength (`lambda_peak`) of the used light source(s).

*extreme example of the over-estimation of ocular media density at `age` = 88 years, and at `lambda_peak` = 405 nm with 6 different half-bandwidths of real commercial light emitters / interference filters. You can see that when using `hbw` = 3 nm interference filters, the error is quite negligible, whereas unfiltered "broadband" LED starts to introduces quite massive error. Positive deltaOD means that real-life SPD (spectral power distribution) overestimates ocular media density over "ideal SPD" with all the energy on single wavelength.* 

*The "TO-Can Narrow linewidth Laser" should be quite close to the "ideal SPD" source, and the code needs some re-checking, as there is some "spectral round-off" error probably happening at light source generation part [monochromaticLightAsGaussian.m](https://github.com/petteriTeikari/spectralLensDensity_purkinjeImages/blob/master/monochromaticLightAsGaussian.m), the "ideal source" is not generated from the same code.*

### Light sources implemented

See the light sources in [lightSource_wrapper.m](https://github.com/petteriTeikari/spectralLensDensity_purkinjeImages/blob/master/lightSource_wrapper.m):
* `hbw` = 8.7500e-05 nm : TO-Can Narrow linewidth Laser - e.g. [Ondax 405 nm CP-405-PLR12](https://www.laserdiodesource.com/shop/405nm-15mW-TO-can-wavelength-stabilized-narrow-linewidth-Ondax)
* `hbw` = 2 nm : TO-Can Budget laser -  e.g. Sony OPTLD004, [Wavespectrum WSLD-405-150m-1](https://www.bbnint.co.uk/documents/data_sheets/Wavespectrum/WSLD-405-150m-1(5.6mm).pdf)
* `hbw` = 3 nm : 3 nm interference filter - e.g. Knight Optical 405 nm [405FIN2](https://www.knightoptical.com/stock/optical-components/uvvisnir-optics/filters/band-pass-filters/interference-bandpass-filters-narrowband-visible-range-405nm---710nm/405nm-bandpass-filter-25diax3nmbw-298606/), [BFI Optilas](http://52ebad10ee97eea25d5e-d7d40819259e7d3022d9ad53e3694148.r84.cf3.rackcdn.com/Interference_Filters_Guide_EN.pdf)
* `hbw` = 10 nm : 10 nm budget interference filter - e.g. EO 405 nm [#65-618](https://www.edmundoptics.co.uk/p/405nm-cwl-125mm-dia-10nm-fwhm-interference-filter/20136/), or UV LED without filter, e.g. [Luminus SST-10-UV](https://download.luminus.com/datasheets/Luminus_SST-10-UV_Datasheet.pdf)
* `hbw` = 15 nm : Narrow-peak LED - e.g. Kingbright 405 nm [ATDS3534UV405B](https://www.mouser.co.uk/datasheet/2/216/ATDS3534UV405B-1374630.pdf)
* `hbw` = 18 nm : Cheapest SMD LED (Â£0.464/pc) - % e.g. [Vishay VLMU3100-GS08](https://www.vishay.com/docs/82556/vlmu3100.pdf)  

### How to use

Run [densityModel_sensitivityAnalysis_v2020.m](https://github.com/petteriTeikari/spectralLensDensity_purkinjeImages/blob/master/densityModel_sensitivityAnalysis_v2020.m)

#### Just play with the error plot

Run [density_error_plot.m](https://github.com/petteriTeikari/spectralLensDensity_purkinjeImages/blob/master/density_error_plot.m), and Matlab will import the pre-computed values from [plot_debug.mat](https://github.com/petteriTeikari/spectralLensDensity_purkinjeImages/blob/master/plot_debug.mat)

##### Or just plot the ocular media density/transmittance

Run [plot_lens_density.m](https://github.com/petteriTeikari/spectralLensDensity_purkinjeImages/blob/master/plot_lens_density.m) that will give you this:

*You see that if you are interested in designing your measurement system that you want to cover the short wavelength range with smaller wavelength increments as most of the density changes happen there, and in general your measurement comes noisier there. You can just throw couple of wavelengths above ~530 nm to constrain your model fit? The `offset` parameter in the [lensModel_vanDeKraats2007.m](https://github.com/petteriTeikari/spectralLensDensity_purkinjeImages/blob/082e4d34cef9532087c14e0387108ae38450156e/lensModel_vanDeKraats2007.m#L36) defines the spectrally neutral "global optical density", and default value of 0.111 was used for this in [lensMediaWrapper.m](https://github.com/petteriTeikari/spectralLensDensity_purkinjeImages/blob/082e4d34cef9532087c14e0387108ae38450156e/lensMediaWrapper.m#L20)*

## Illumination intensity compensation

Run [plot_compensated_lights.m)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/petteriTeikari/spectralLensDensity_purkinjeImages/master/plot_compensated_lights.m) which will approximate how much you should boost short wavelengths even to detect the 4th Purkinje image on shorter wavelengths (See ["Illumination compensation
" in Wiki](https://github.com/petteriTeikari/spectralLensDensity_purkinjeImages/wiki/Simulation-Literature-Review) for rationale behind this plot)

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/petteriTeikari/spectralLensDensity_purkinjeImages/master/figures/illuminationCorrection_on_lensDensity_and_CameraSensitivity.png)

_The 60 year old template lens should have as large as 2 log unit compensation if you would be using 400 nm peak wavelengths by simple transmittance attenuation analysis_
