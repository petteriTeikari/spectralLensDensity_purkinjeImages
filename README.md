# spectralLensDensity_purkinjeImages

Quick'n'dirty approximation of the error in spectral ocular media density estimation using Purkinje images as a function of the (virtual) `age` (as specified by the [van de Kraats and van Norren 2007](https://doi.org/10.1364/JOSAA.24.001842) ocular media model, see [lensMediaWrapper.m](https://github.com/petteriTeikari/spectralLensDensity_purkinjeImages/blob/master/lensMediaWrapper.m) and [lensModel_vanDeKraats2007.m](https://github.com/petteriTeikari/spectralLensDensity_purkinjeImages/blob/master/lensModel_vanDeKraats2007.m) for code), half-bandwidth (`hbw`) and peak wavelength (`lambda_peak`) of the used light source(s).

*extreme example of the over-estimation of ocular media density at `age` = 88 years, and at `lambda_peak` = 405 nm with 6 different half-bandwidths of real commercial light emitters / interference filters. You can see that when using `hbw` = 3 nm interference filters, the error is quite negligible, whereas unfiltered "broadband" LED starts to introduces quite massive error. Positive deltaOD means that real-life SPD (spectral power distribution) overestimates ocular media density over "ideal SPD" with all the energy on single wavelength.* 

*The "TO-Can Narrow linewidth Laser" should be quite close to the "ideal SPD" source, and the code needs some re-checking, as there is some "spectral round-off" error probably happening at light source generation part [monochromaticLightAsGaussian.m](https://github.com/petteriTeikari/spectralLensDensity_purkinjeImages/blob/master/monochromaticLightAsGaussian.m), the "ideal source" is not generated from the same code.*

## How to use

Run [densityModel_sensitivityAnalysis_v2020.m](https://github.com/petteriTeikari/spectralLensDensity_purkinjeImages/blob/master/densityModel_sensitivityAnalysis_v2020.m)

### Just play with the error plot

Run [density_error_plot.m](https://github.com/petteriTeikari/spectralLensDensity_purkinjeImages/blob/master/density_error_plot.m), and Matlab will import the pre-computed values from [plot_debug.mat](https://github.com/petteriTeikari/spectralLensDensity_purkinjeImages/blob/master/plot_debug.mat)

#### Or just plot the ocular media density/transmittance

Run [plot_lens_density.m](https://github.com/petteriTeikari/spectralLensDensity_purkinjeImages/blob/master/plot_lens_density.m) that will give you this:

*You see that if you are interested in designing your measurement system that you want to cover the short wavelength range with smaller wavelength increments as most of the density changes happen there, and in general your measurement comes noisier there. You can just throw couple of wavelengths above ~530 nm to constrain your model fit?*

And if you would take out the crystalline lens from aged human eye (done during cataract surgery), the result would look something like this:

If you are interested in using these to simulate how photoreception response (whatever your interest may be, e.g. circadian rhythms, pupillary light reflex, melatonin suppression, electroretinography, EEG, you name it), you can play with these artificial light sources for example (defined on 1 nm steps between 380 and 780 nm): https://github.com/petteriTeikari/lightLab/tree/master/database/LightSources/artificial. 

You can see the the "effective correlated color temperature (CCT)" changes quite drastically for older lenses, and one could question of using very high CCT light sources in elderly care homes for example if nothing really goes through the ocular media? Assuming that the elderly still have their natural crystalline lenses, and have not gone through a cataract surgery with a new intraocular lens (IOL)? 

And with the increasing popularity of violet-pumped white LEDs (e.g. [SORAA Bluefree/Zeroblue/Healthy](https://www.soraa.com/soraa-pro/technology/zeroblue.php), [Nichia Optisolis](https://www.nichia.co.jp/en/product/led_sp_optisolis.html), [YUJILEDS VTC range](https://www.yujiintl.com/tunable-spectrum.html), [Seoul SunLike](http://www.seoulsemicon.com/en/technology); and the attempt to [avoid 460 nm pumping (Leslie Lyons)](https://www.ledsmagazine.com/leds-ssl-design/article/14039534/is-it-time-to-say-goodbye-to-bluepump-leds-magazine)), and interesting question would be how colors are perceived and what are the nonvisual effects of such light sources through dense ocular media in elderly?

## TODO!

### PSF of ocular media layers

It would be interesting to have some estimate of the **point-spread-function (PSF)** of the different surfaces, as remember that (from [Navarro et al. 1986](https://doi.org/10.1364/JOSAA.3.000228)):

*The **first and the fourth Purkinje images** can be considered **specular** images, whereas the **second and the third are diffuse**. The first image is specular because, in spite of the roughness of the corneal epithelium, the reflection takes place in the surface of the tear layer that covers the anterior surface of the cornea.* 

And from [Pau Santos (2018)](https://upcommons.upc.edu/handle/2117/121192):

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/petteriTeikari/spectralLensDensity_purkinjeImages/master/figures/pauSantos2018_fresnelEquations_purkinjeImages.png)

Thus, qualitatively it is very hard to capture the 2nd and 3rd Purkinje Images, and when you remember where the reflections are coming (see below), realistically you can hope to capture the difference between the 1st and 4th Purkinje image (i.e. the ocular media density without knowing how much cornea and crystalline lens contribute). In practice this is all you want to know when wanting to know how to pre-filter your light stimulus to ensure that the retinal irradiance / photon flux is constant across your subjects (i.e. you want to study if there are [compensatory mechanisms with aging at "ocular"/retinal/(sub)cortical level](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0085837) with age for non-image forming (NIF) photoreception)

#### Zemax model with proper optomechanical alignment?

Might take some optimization to get nicely separated Purkinje Images (see below A for [Pau Santos (2018)](https://upcommons.upc.edu/handle/2117/121192)'s analysis on the relation image size and object distance) with extra set of non-Purkinje reflection possibly occurring (see below B from [Mariana Quelhas Dias Rodrigues Almeida (2012)](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Detection-of-purkinje-images-for-automatic-of-and-Almeida/9e9cf0d52edded3151898e21db6634d98a8b6f9b))

### Camera Modeling

At the moment the camera's quantum efficiency is imported with no idea of the absolute irradiance / photon flux of the light source(s) used. You want your setup to comply to the standard [ISO 15004-2:2007 âOphthalmic instruments -- Fundamental requirements and test methods - Part 2: Light hazard protectionâ](https://www.iso.org/standard/38952.html) to not cause hazard for the eyes of the subjects. This in turn means that you should calculate your absolute irradiances in any case, and then you could plug those values to your camera model and measure/estimate the effect of camera selection to your final ocular media density estimates?

[Pau Santos (2018)](https://upcommons.upc.edu/handle/2117/121192) serves again as nice reference how to calculate the limit values for continuous-wave instruments (opposed to pulsed light source with high peak values):

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/petteriTeikari/spectralLensDensity_purkinjeImages/master/figures/safetyLimits.png)

_Table 3.2 of the ISO 15004-2:2007 âLimit values for continuous wave instrumentsâ, Group 1 limit values for continuous wave instruments (Table 2, 5.4.1.4 of the ISO 15004-2:2007; Table 2, 5.4.1.6 of the ISO 15004-2:2007)_

### Limitations

#### Lack of spatial map

We really cannot get the crystalline lens density as a spatial map (as possible with SS-OCT with NIR Laser, see e.g.  [Alberto de Castro et al. 2018](https://doi.org/10.1167/iovs.17-23596); and EU's [Galahad Project](https://galahad-project.eu/) for developing low-cost supercontinuum light sources allowing visible light OCT, e.g. [Shu et al. 2019](https://dx.doi.org/10.21037%2Fqims.2019.05.01) and [Chong et al. 2018](https://doi.org/10.1364/BOE.9.001477)), thus the interest of big pharma is probably limited for using Purkinje images-based system to track the efficacy of their cataract-stopping/reversing medication. Likewise, some researchers working on Alzheimer's Disease might want to revisit the "biomarker hunt" with equatorial supranuclear cataracts below the lens capsule (see e.g. [Goldstein et al. 2003](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(03)12981-9), [Michael et al. 2013](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.exer.2012.10.012); and reviewed by [Chang et al. 2014](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jalz.2013.06.004). See below examples of SS-OCT scans:

***(A)** Optical coherence tomography images obtained from the CASIA2 anterior and posterior lens boundary are automatically drawn (orange dot lines), and their curvatures are calculated by the built-in software. Optic axis of lens (vertical orange dot lines) and vertex normal (vertical blue solid line) are automatically drawn and crystalline lens thickness is also calculated by the built-in software (vertical orange solid line) [Shoji et al. 2016](http://dx.doi.org/10.1136/bmjophth-2016-000058), **(B)**  Post-processing of volumetric SS-OCT data of the 26-yo healthy young subject.

Central cross-section (A, E), lateral projection (B, F) of the maximum intensity, axial projection of the anterior (C, G), and the posterior (D, H) part of the crystalline lens. Although the anterior segment of the crystalline lens (C, G) seems normal, the observation of the posterior segment (D, H) reveals the shape and extent of the posterior subcapsular cataract. Scale bars: 1 mm [Alberto de Castro et al. 2018](https://doi.org/10.1167/iovs.17-23596).*

#### Need for high dynamic range -> higher setup cost

The "need for >8-bit dynamic range increased the cost of the camera needed, thus some computational approaches are needed for "multiframe-HDR" probably and use of some embedded deep learning-"compatible" platform such as NVIDIA Nano / NVIDIA Xavier NX (see [define_camera_spectral_sensitivity.m](https://github.com/petteriTeikari/spectralLensDensity_purkinjeImages/blob/37c7bdd0cd91462e6c85d4375b8289488a8eb66a/define_camera_spectral_sensitivity.m#L57) for some links to start your search)

#### Intraocular light scatter as extra?

Combination of this ocular media density assessment with the intraocular light measurement by [Pau Santos (2018)](https://upcommons.upc.edu/handle/2117/121192)) (to replace [OCULUS C-Quant from 2005](https://www.oculus.de/en/products/visual-test-equipment/c-quant/highlights/)) would be interesting? And if you put effort in making the device as inexpensive and even open-source, it could be used in a lot of photoreception laboratories and low-resource settings routinely if the user experience (UX) is good (as the cost of SS-OCT "gold standard" is quite substantial for non-spectral purposes)
